1. Is that plugin's Overlay capabilities enabled in EDMC Settings?



| Troubleshooting Step | Remediation | 
|---------------------|---------------------|
|Do you have EDMCModernOverlay installed? | If you have no overlay or a legacy overlay installed, download the [latest release](https://github.com/SweetJonnySauce/EDMCModernOverlay/releases/latest) of EDMCModernOverlay and run the installer for your OS. |
| Do you have an "Enabled Plugins" list on the plugins tab of EDMC Settings? (File > Settings > Plugins) | Upgrade EDMC to version 6.1.0 or greater. |
| Does EDMCModernOverlay show as enabled on the plugins tab in EDMC Settings? | Go to File > Settings > plugins in EDMC and enable EDMCModernOverlay. |
| Do you have another plugin installed that has Overlay capabilities? | Install an EDMC plugin that has overlay support (e.g. BGS-Tally, Bioscan, LandingPad,EDR) |
| Is that plugin showing up as enabled on the plugins tab in EDMC Settings? | Go to File > Settings > plugins in EDMC and enable the plugin. |
| Is that plugin's Overlay capabilities enabled in EDMC Settings? | Go to the respective plugin tab (not the EDMCModernOverlay tab) in EDMC Settings (File > Settings) and enable the overlay. Test that overlay in-game to see if an overlay shows up. |
