# Linux distribution installation compatibility

This is an **installer compatibility matrix**. It shows the Linux distributions that
`install_linux.sh` recognizes and the dependencies it installs for each one.

It is not a runtime display compatibility matrix. A recognized distribution means the
installer has a package profile for it; it does not mean every desktop, compositor, or
display session on that distribution is validated. See [[Backend Compatibility]] for
runtime display status.

## What every Linux install needs

- Python 3.10 or newer.
- `pip` and virtual-environment support.
- An installer-recognized distribution profile below, or the equivalent packages installed
  manually.
- A client virtual environment. The installer installs `PyQt6>=6.5` in it.

For Wayland sessions, the installer also installs `pydbus>=0.6.0`,
`pywayland>=0.4.15`, and `PyQt6-Qt6>=6.5` in that virtual environment. It installs the
profile's Wayland system packages only when it detects a Wayland session; an unknown
session skips those packages.

`install_matrix.json` has no distribution-version limits. A version is eligible when it
matches a profile and provides the required packages and Python version.

The installer uses these profile-specific package names for the common Python tooling:

| Distribution profile | Python, pip, and virtual-environment packages |
| --- | --- |
| Debian / Ubuntu | `python3`, `python3-venv`, `python3-pip` |
| Fedora / RHEL / CentOS Stream | `python3`, `python3-pip`, `python3-virtualenv` |
| Bazzite (Fedora rpm-ostree) | `python3`, `python3-pip`, `python3-virtualenv` |
| openSUSE / SLE | `python3`, `python3-pip`, `python3-virtualenv` |
| Arch / Manjaro / SteamOS | `python`, `python-pip` |

## Distribution profiles

All package names below are the exact names in `install_matrix.json`. **Base** and
**Qt/X11** packages are installed for every recognized Linux session. **Wayland**
packages are added only for a detected Wayland session. **Flatpak add-on** is added only
when EDMC is installed as a Flatpak.

| Distribution profile | Recognized `/etc/os-release` IDs | Package manager | Other base packages | Qt/X11 packages | Wayland packages | Flatpak add-on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Debian / Ubuntu | `debian`, `ubuntu`, `pop`, `linuxmint`, `neon`, `zorin`, `kali`, `parrot`; compatible `ID_LIKE=debian` or `ubuntu` | `apt-get` | `rsync`, `curl`, `wmctrl` | `libxcb-cursor0`, `libxkbcommon-x11-0` | `x11-utils` | None in the manifest |
| Fedora / RHEL / CentOS Stream | `fedora`, `rhel`, `centos`, `rocky`, `almalinux`; compatible `ID_LIKE=fedora` or `rhel` | `dnf` | `rsync`, `curl`, `wmctrl` | `libxkbcommon`, `libxkbcommon-x11`, `xcb-util-cursor` | `xwininfo`, `xprop` | `flatpak-spawn` |
| Bazzite (Fedora rpm-ostree) | `bazzite` | `rpm-ostree` | `rsync`, `curl`, `wmctrl` | `libxkbcommon`, `libxkbcommon-x11`, `xcb-util-cursor` | `xwininfo`, `xprop`, `plasma-wayland-protocols`, `wayland-devel`, `python3.<minor>-devel` | `flatpak-spawn` |
| openSUSE / SLE | `opensuse`, `opensuse-leap`, `opensuse-tumbleweed`, `sles`; compatible `ID_LIKE=suse` | `zypper` | `rsync`, `curl`, `wmctrl` | `libxcb-cursor0`, `libxkbcommon-x11-0` | `xprop`, `xwininfo` | None in the manifest |
| Arch / Manjaro / SteamOS | `arch`, `manjaro`, `endeavouros`, `steamos`; compatible `ID_LIKE=arch` | `pacman` | `rsync`, `curl`, `wmctrl` | `libxcb`, `xcb-util-cursor`, `libxkbcommon` | `xorg-xprop`, `xorg-xwininfo` | None in the manifest |

`python3.<minor>-devel` in the Bazzite profile is expanded to match the detected Python
minor version. On rpm-ostree systems, package changes can require a reboot before the
new deployment is active.

## Flatpak EDMC

Flatpak is an installation context, not a separate overlay backend. The overlay client
runs on the host through `flatpak-spawn --host`, so the EDMC Flatpak must have session
bus permission for `org.freedesktop.Flatpak`. The installer checks for this and provides
the command if it is missing:

```bash
flatpak override --user io.edcd.EDMarketConnector --talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak
```

Grant this only if you trust the plugin and the host system: host launch runs the overlay
client outside the Flatpak sandbox.

## What this matrix does not claim

This page does not validate a particular desktop/compositor, display session, game
configuration, monitor layout, or scaling arrangement. Use [[Backend Compatibility]]
for those claims.
