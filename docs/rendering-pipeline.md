# Rendering & Tracing Pipeline

This document explains how a payload travels from EDMC into the Modern Overlay client, which components participate, and which tracing stages you can expect in the logs.

## 1. Configuration & gating

1. `debug.json` is read by both the EDMC plugin (`load.py`) and the overlay client (`overlay_client/debug_config.py`).  
2. Dev builds (or `MODERN_OVERLAY_DEV_MODE=1`) enable the debug configuration.  
3. `tracing.enabled` gates all subsequent trace output; `tracing.payload_ids` is interpreted as `str.startswith` prefixes. When the list is empty, every payload can emit traces.  
4. Payload logging and tracing can be toggled independently.  
5. `capture_client_stderrout` mirrors the overlay client's stdout/stderr back into EDMC’s log (still gated by EDMC’s DEBUG log level).

## 2. EDMC plugin path

1. Journal/external payloads flow through `_PluginRuntime._publish_payload()` inside `load.py`.  
2. Legacy TCP payloads are normalised via `normalise_legacy_payload()` before they are published.  
3. Overrides specified in `overlay_groupings.json` and the plugin override engine are applied.  
4. The plugin broadcasts payloads to the overlay client via the watchdog-managed socket.

## 3. Overlay client intake

1. `OverlayDataClient` reads payloads off the socket (`overlay_client/data_client.py`) and forwards them to `OverlayWindow`.  
2. Modern-overlay payloads update the live state; legacy-formatted payloads (most third-party overlays) are sent to `_handle_legacy()`.  
3. `_handle_legacy()` extracts `plugin`/`id`, applies overrides, emits `post_override` traces when tracing is enabled, and calls `process_legacy_payload()` with a trace callback.

## 4. Legacy processing & storage

1. `process_legacy_payload()` (in `overlay_client/legacy_processor.py`) normalises each payload type:
   - `message` → text payload with color/position/size metadata.
   - `shape:rect` → rectangle payload with fill/border data.
   - `shape:vect` → vector payload with ordered points, optional markers/text. Marker label `size` accepts
     legacy presets (`small`, `normal`, `large`, `huge`); payload-level `size`/`text_size` provides the
     default, per-point `size` overrides it, missing/invalid values fall back to `normal`, and `size` is
     ignored for points without `text`.
   - Other shapes/raw payloads are stored for future handling.
2. The helper emits trace events such as:
   - `legacy_processor:vector_single_point_extended`
   - `legacy_processor:vector_normalised`
3. The processed payload is written into `LegacyItemStore`. Its setter fires `legacy_store:set` traces and notifies the window that a repaint is needed.

## 5. Grouping & viewport preparation

1. `OverlayWindow.paintEvent()` drains `LegacyItemStore` and groups payloads using `PluginOverrideManager`.  
2. For Fill mode, `FillGroupingHelper.prepare()` builds per-group bounds and anchor metadata (see `docs/fill-mode-baseline.md`).  
3. Each payload is paired with a `LegacyMapper` / `FillViewport` that captures the window size, scale factor, offsets, and any proportional translations required to keep grouped payloads rigid.  
4. `_should_trace_payload()` re-checks the tracing filters for each item before any logging happens.

## 6. Paint command construction

For every legacy item, the window builds a paint command. Each builder emits input/output trace stages when tracing is enabled.

### Messages (`_build_message_command`)

1. Compute scaled font size, remap the logical `(x, y)` via `remap_point()`, and apply inverse group scale/proportional translation if Fill mode is active.  
2. Emit:
   - `paint:message_input` (raw coordinates, scale, offsets, font size)
   - `paint:message_output` (adjusted overlay coords, pixel baseline, text width)  
3. Attach a `trace_fn` that later logs `render_message:draw`.

### Rectangles (`_build_rect_command`)

1. Build pen/brush from payload colors and compute remapped rectangle corners via `remap_rect_points()`.  
2. Emit:
   - `paint:rect_input`
   - `paint:rect_output` (both overlay-space and pixel-space bounds)  
3. Resulting `_RectPaintCommand` does not emit additional traces during painting.

### Vectors (`_build_vector_command`)

1. Log `paint:scale_factors` (scale, offsets, Fill mode) and `paint:raw_points`.  
2. Remap each point through `remap_vector_points()`, apply inverse group scale and proportional translation.  
3. Build `_VectorPaintCommand` with a `trace_fn` that `render_vector()` uses to emit `render_vector:scaled_points` (the pixel-space line segments).

## 7. Final paint execution

1. `OverlayWindow` iterates paint commands per group.  
2. `_MessagePaintCommand.paint()` sets the font, draws the text, then logs `render_message:draw`.  
3. `_RectPaintCommand.paint()` draws rectangles with the configured pen/brush.  
4. `_VectorPaintCommand.paint()` calls `render_vector()`, which draws each segment/marker and emits `render_vector:scaled_points`.  
5. Each paint command can register a cycle anchor so the “cycle payload IDs” developer feature knows where to highlight focus points.

Use these stages to verify that every phase—from ingestion through final paint—behaves as expected for the payload IDs you are tracing.
