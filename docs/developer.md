# Developer Notes

## Development Tips

- VS Code launch configurations exist for the overlay client and the standalone broadcast server harness.
- Plugin-side logs route through EDMC when `config.log` is present; otherwise they fall back to stdout. The overlay client writes to `logs/EDMCModernOverlay/overlay_client.log`.
- Background tasks run on daemon threads so EDMC can exit cleanly even if the overlay client is still doing work.
- When testing the window-follow path, toggle the developer debug overlay (Shift+F10 by default) to inspect monitor, overlay, and font metrics. The status label now only reports the connection banner and window position so it never changes the overlay geometry.
- Other plugins can detect Modern Overlay (and the version they are talking to) via `MODERN_OVERLAY_IDENTITY`, which is exported from `EDMCOverlay.edmcoverlay`. Because `edmcoverlay.py` re-exports that module, consumers can simply `import edmcoverlay` and inspect `edmcoverlay.MODERN_OVERLAY_IDENTITY` for `{"plugin": "EDMCModernOverlay", "version": "<semver>"}`. Gate Modern Overlay-specific behaviour behind that check instead of probing files on disk.
- Example detection helper:
  ```python
  import edmcoverlay

  identity = getattr(edmcoverlay, "MODERN_OVERLAY_IDENTITY", None)
  if identity and identity.get("plugin") == "EDMCModernOverlay":
      version = identity.get("version", "unknown")
      print(f"Modern Overlay v{version} detected")
  ```
- Clearing a legacy payload now mirrors every legacy path: sending `text=""` **or** calling `send_raw({"id": "payload-id"})` normalises to a `legacy_clear` event. The shim logs the event, the plugin mirrors it to `overlay-payloads.log`, and the overlay client removes the matching `id` even if the request originated from the WebSocket CLI.

## Declaring plugin groups via API

The public helper module also exposes `define_plugin_group()` so plugins can register their own grouping metadata without editing `overlay_groupings.json` manually. The helper enforces the schema constraints already in place and lowercases/uniquifies prefixes for you.

See [`docs/overlay-groupings.md`](https://github.com/SweetJonnySauce/EDMC-ModernOverlay/blob/main/docs/overlay-groupings.md) for more information.

```python
from overlay_plugin.overlay_api import define_plugin_group, PluginGroupingError

try:
    define_plugin_group(
        plugin_group="MyPlugin",
        matching_prefixes=["myplugin-"],
        id_prefix_group="alerts",
        id_prefixes=["myplugin-alert-"],
        id_prefix_group_anchor="ne",
    )
except PluginGroupingError as exc:
    # Modern Overlay isn't running or the call was invalid
    print(f"Could not register grouping: {exc}")
```

- `plugin_group` is the JSON root key. Provide at least one of `matching_prefixes`, `id_prefix_group`, `id_prefixes`, or `id_prefix_group_anchor`.
- `matching_prefixes` replaces the existing list; when `id_prefixes` is supplied, any missing entries are appended automatically (add-only) and scoped to the plugin.
- `id_prefix_group` identifies/creates the nested block. Creating a new group requires `id_prefixes`; later calls can update just the anchor.
- `id_prefix_group_anchor` must be one of the nine overlay anchors (`nw`, `ne`, …). Send it alongside the group name (and optionally new prefixes) to overwrite the stored anchor.
- Optional background fields: `background_color` and `background_border_color` accept named colors or `#RRGGBB`/`#AARRGGBB` (alpha optional). `background_border_width` accepts integers 0–10 to expand the fill equally on all sides; the border is a fixed 1px stroke drawn outside the expanded fill. Omit all background fields to keep the group transparent.

Every call rewrites `overlay_groupings.json`, so keep the file under version control, document intentional changes (for example in release notes), and cover new plugin groups with regression tests. Pull requests should include the updated JSON plus any developer notes explaining the new prefixes.

## Shipped vs. user groupings

- Shipped defaults live in `overlay_groupings.json`. User overrides (controller writes, per-install tweaks) live beside it in `overlay_groupings.user.json` and must be preserved on upgrade.
- Merge rules: shipped is the base; user entries overlay per plugin/group; user-only entries are allowed; `disabled: true` in the user file hides the shipped entry at that scope.
- Write targets: the controller writes only the user file (diffed against shipped defaults). `define_plugin_group()` and other plugin APIs continue to write the shipped file so third-party plugins can register defaults safely.
- Paths: `MODERN_OVERLAY_USER_GROUPINGS_PATH` can point the user file elsewhere for tests/tools; otherwise the plugin root path is used.
- Reset: delete/rename the user file to fall back to shipped defaults; user-only entries disappear.

## Versioning

- The release number lives in `version.py` (`__version__`). Bump it before tagging so EDMC, the overlay client, and API consumers remain in sync.
- `load.py` exposes that version via EDMC metadata fields and records it in `port.json` next to the broadcast port (along with a `log_level` block that advertises EDMC’s current logging level).
- The overlay client shows the running version in the “Connected to …” banner, making it easy to confirm which build is active.
- Developer builds inherit BGSTally-style semantics: append `-dev` (or any `.dev*` suffix) to `__version__` **or** export `MODERN_OVERLAY_DEV_MODE=1` before launching EDMC to force dev mode. Dev builds default the plugin logger to DEBUG and log a startup banner; set `MODERN_OVERLAY_DEV_MODE=0` to suppress dev behaviour while keeping the `-dev` version string.
- The dev override now forces every Modern Overlay logger (plugin, PyQt client, overlay controller, payload mirror) to DEBUG even if EDMC’s log level stays at INFO/WARN, and identifies that override in each log file so we know whether DEBUG came from EDMC or dev mode.
- Before packaging a release, generate per-file SHA256s for the payload with `python scripts/generate_checksums.py`; the installers (Linux and Windows) will validate the extracted bundle and the installed copy against `checksums.txt`.
- `debug.json` is only read when dev mode is active. Release builds ignore every flag in that file, so set `MODERN_OVERLAY_DEV_MODE=1` (or bump the version suffix to `-dev`) before relying on payload mirroring, group outlines, or trace helpers. When EDMC’s log level is DEBUG, the plugin now auto-creates `debug.json` (even in release builds) and pipes overlay stdout/stderr back to EDMC; dev mode bypasses the EDMC gate so stdout capture stays active even if EDMC logging isn’t DEBUG. During the logging refactor we’ll carve dev-only helpers into a new `dev_settings.json` (created/read only when dev mode is enabled) so `debug.json` stays focused on troubleshooting switches such as capture, payload logging, and log retention.

## Tests

- Lightweight regression scenarios live in `overlay_client/tests`. `test_geometry_override.py` covers window-manager override classification, including fractional window sizes that previously caused geometry thrash.
- Install `pytest` in the client virtualenv and run `python -m pytest overlay_client/tests` to execute the suite.

## Payload ID Finder Overlay

Modern Overlay includes a developer-facing “payload ID finder” that helps trace which legacy payload is currently targeted. When you enable **Cycle through Payload IDs** in the preferences, the overlay shows a floating badge containing:

- The active `payload_id`
- The originating plugin name (if known)
- The computed center coordinates of the payload on screen
- Runtime diagnostics: remaining TTL (or `∞` when persistent), how long ago the payload last updated, the payload kind (message/rect/vector with relevant size info), and a breakdown of the active Fill transforms (remap, preservation shift, translation)

This is particularly useful when capturing coordinates or validating grouping behaviour.

> **Important:** If “Compensate for Elite Dangerous title bar” is enabled, the center coordinates displayed in the payload ID finder will be inaccurate. Title bar compensation translates the overlay to align with the game window, but the badge still uses the original, uncompensated coordinates. Disable the compensation setting when you need precise center values from the finder.

### Tips

- Toggle payload cycling with the controls in the preferences.
- Enable “Copy current payload ID to clipboard” if you want each ID handed to the clipboard automatically while stepping through items. The checkbox is automatically disabled (but keeps its state) whenever cycling itself is turned off, then becomes active again when cycling is re-enabled.
- The connector line from the badge points toward the payload’s anchor point, helping locate overlapping elements quickly.
- Plugin names and coordinates rely on the metadata provided by each payload; if a plugin does not populate `plugin` fields, the finder falls back to `unknown`.
- The transform breakdown is listed in the order the renderer applies it:
  1. **Fill scale** shows the raw X/Y proportions computed for Fill mode along with the effective values after aspect preservation (`raw → applied`). Fill mode scales by the larger of the window’s horizontal/vertical ratios so the 1280×960 legacy canvas covers the window completely; one axis therefore overflows and requires proportional remapping. (Fit mode, by contrast, uses the smaller ratio so the entire canvas remains inside the window.)
  2. **Fill preserve shift** appears when a group is preserving aspect; it reports the group-wide translation we inject to avoid squashing.
  3. **Fill translation** is the per-group dx/dy derived from bounds that keeps the payload inside the window (assertion #7).
 All values are in overlay coordinates to make it easy to compare against raw payload dumps (e.g. `payload_store/edr_docking.log`) when tuning Fill behaviour.
- The payload finder’s callout line is configurable. See **Line width overrides** below if you need a thicker/thinner connector.

### Line width overrides

Modern Overlay centralises common pen widths in `overlay_client/render_config.json`. Adjust the values to tune debug visuals without touching code:

- `grid`: spacing grid rendered by the developer background toggle (debug only).
- `group_outline`: dashed bounding box drawn when `group_bounds_outline` is enabled (debug only).
- `viewport_indicator`: the oversized orange guideline arrows that show Fill overflow (debug only).
- `legacy_rect`: outline for legacy `shape="rect"` payloads.
- `vector_line`: the main stroke used for vector payloads (sparklines, trend lines, guidance beams).
- `vector_marker`: the filled circle marker drawn when a vector point specifies `"marker": "circle"`.
- `vector_cross`: the X-shaped marker used for `"marker": "cross"` points.
- `cycle_connector`: the payload finder’s connector from the center badge to the active overlay (debug only).

Values are in pixels. Restart the overlay client after editing the JSON file.

## Debug Overlay Reference

Enable **Show debug overlay** to surface a live diagnostics panel in the corner of the overlay. It mirrors most of the geometry/scale state the client is using:

- **Monitor block** lists the active display (with the computed aspect ratio) and the tracker window the overlay is following. The tracker entry shows the Elite window’s top-left coordinate and the captured width/height in game pixels. If the overlay is offset (e.g., due to title bar compensation) you’ll see a second `wm_rect` line describing the size the window manager believes the overlay occupies.
- **Overlay block** lists:
  - `widget`: the actual QWidget size in logical pixels, with aspect ratio.
  - `frame`: the Qt frame geometry (includes window frame and drop shadows when present).
  - `phys`: the size after multiplying by the device pixel ratio, i.e., the true number of physical screen pixels the overlay occupies.
  - `raw`: the Elite window geometry that legacy payloads are targeting; this is the reference rectangle used for coordinate normalisation.
  - `scale`: the resolved legacy scale factors (`legacy_x`, `legacy_y`) plus the active scaling `mode` (`fit` or `fill`).
  These values are useful when diagnosing mismatched HUD scaling or when confirming that group offsets line up with the monitored window.
- **Fonts block** records:
  - Legacy scale factors (`scale_x`, `scale_y`, `diag`) derived from window size.
  - `ui_scale`: the user’s current font scaling multiplier.
  - `bounds`: the min/max font point clamping that payloads are restricted to.
  - Live font sizes (`message`, `status`, `legacy`) after clamping and scaling.
  - `legacy presets`: the resolved point sizes for the classic `small`, `normal`, `large`, and `huge` presets so you can see exactly what each payload’s `size` value maps to.
- **Settings block** highlights the title-bar compensation flag and height, along with the actual pixel offset applied. If compensation is enabled but the offset seems wrong, this is the first place to verify the numbers.

These details are helpful when debugging sizing issues (e.g., 21:9 vs. 4:3 monitors) or verifying that Fill-mode remaps are behaving as expected.

## Debug configuration files

### `debug.json` (troubleshooting)

`debug.json` is honoured whenever diagnostics are enabled (EDMC log level = DEBUG or dev mode), regardless of whether the build is tagged `-dev`. Missing keys are auto-populated by the plugin when diagnostics turn on; edits require an overlay restart to propagate.

| Key | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `capture_client_stderrout` | `true` | Pipe overlay stdout/stderr back to the EDMC log (only emitted when diagnostics are active). |
| `payload_logging.overlay_payload_log_enabled` | `true` | Mirror payloads to `logs/EDMCModernOverlay/overlay-payloads.log`; combine with `exclude_plugins` to suppress noisy sources. |
| `payload_logging.exclude_plugins` | `[]` | Lowercase prefixes of plugins to skip when mirroring payloads (e.g., `"bgstally-"`). |
| `overlay_logs_to_keep` | `5` | Rotating overlay log retention (count of files), clamped to [1,20]. |

Example payload emitted by `_ensure_default_debug_config()`:

```json
{
  "capture_client_stderrout": true,
  "overlay_logs_to_keep": 5,
  "payload_logging": {
    "overlay_payload_log_enabled": true,
    "exclude_plugins": []
  }
}
```

The Diagnostics group in the EDMC preferences tab simply edits this file for you; only touch it manually when pre-seeding capture/log-retention defaults in automated test environments.

### `dev_settings.json` (dev mode only)

Dev mode (`MODERN_OVERLAY_DEV_MODE=1` or `__version__` suffixed with `-dev`) unlocks high-risk helpers controlled by `dev_settings.json`. The plugin auto-creates this file the first time dev mode turns on; the overlay client/controller read it directly so edits take effect after a restart.

| Key | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tracing.enabled` | `false` | Enable legacy payload tracing (mirrors payloads to `overlay-payloads.log` and adds per-payload trace hooks). |
| `tracing.payload_ids` | `[]` | Optional allowlist of payload IDs/prefixes to trace; leave empty to trace all when tracing is enabled. |
| `overlay_outline` | `true` | Draw a dashed border around the overlay window (debug overlay aid). |
| `group_bounds_outline` | `true` | Draw dashed rectangles/anchors for cached groups (useful for Fill tuning). |
| `payload_vertex_markers` | `false` | Render per-vertex debug markers for vector payloads. |
| `repaint_debounce_enabled` | `true` | Enable the 33 ms repaint debounce for ingest/purge bursts; set `false` to bypass for troubleshooting. |
| `log_repaint_debounce` | `false` | Emit debug logs for repaint requests/debounce path plus 5s repaint/text-measure stats. |

Sample dev payload (written when the file is missing):

```json
{
  "tracing": {
    "enabled": false,
    "payload_ids": []
  },
  "overlay_outline": true,
  "group_bounds_outline": true,
  "payload_vertex_markers": false,
  "repaint_debounce_enabled": true,
  "log_repaint_debounce": false
}
```

If you add a new troubleshooting or dev flag, update `DEFAULT_DEBUG_CONFIG` or `DEFAULT_DEV_SETTINGS` respectively, extend the loader/tests, and document the new key in this section so downstream tooling knows where to persist it.

### Fill-mode diagnostics

Enable `group_bounds_outline` in `dev_settings.json` to render dashed rectangles (plus anchor dots) for each cached group while tuning Fill mode behaviour. Because Fill scales the legacy canvas until one axis overflows, these outlines make it easy to confirm that related payloads are translating together and remaining rigid even when they extend beyond the visible window.

## Transform Pipeline Overview

The current scaling flow is intentionally broken into Qt-aware and Qt-free layers so we can reason about transforms everywhere (Fit, Fill, grouping) without leaking widget details:

1. **Window → ViewportTransform**  
   `OverlayWindow` samples the widget width/height and devicePixelRatioF, then calls `viewport_helper.compute_viewport_transform()`. That helper decides the Fit/Fill scale about logical `(0,0)` and returns the canvas offsets that center or pin the 1280×960 surface inside the window, along with `overflow_x/overflow_y`.
   - In **Fill** mode the helper keeps the legacy origin anchored at the window’s `(0,0)` corner; overflow simply extends past the right/bottom edges so coordinate systems remain aligned with the physical window.

2. **ViewportTransform → LegacyMapper**  
   We wrap just the uniform `scale_x/scale_y` and base `offset_x/offset_y` into a `LegacyMapper`. This struct carries the Qt-derived values to code that otherwise never touches Qt.

3. **LegacyMapper → FillViewport**  
   `viewport_transform.build_viewport()` receives the mapper, a plain `ViewportState` (width, height, device ratio), and any cached `GroupTransform`. It produces a `FillViewport` object that painters use to map logical coordinates to screen pixels, while preserving group anchors/metadata. This is the first place payload coordinates are evaluated after the base Fit/Fill scale.
   - When the mapper is in Fill mode we cache each group’s anchor so the renderer can “undo” the Fill scale around that pivot, keeping grouped payloads at their original logical size even though the viewport itself was scaled up.

4. **FillViewport → payload remappers**  
   `payload_transform.py` (messages/rectangles/vectors) consumes `FillViewport` to remap payload points, apply plugin overrides, and hand back overlay coordinates. `grouping_helper.py` iterates live payloads, accumulates `GroupTransform` bounds/anchors, and caches them for subsequent paint calls.

When adding new behaviour, update `payload_transform` first so grouping and rendering stay in sync, then layer viewport-specific adjustments in `viewport_transform`. `OverlayWindow` should remain the only place that touches PyQt6 APIs.
